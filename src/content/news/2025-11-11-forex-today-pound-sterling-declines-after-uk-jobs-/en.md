The Pound Sterling fell after the release of disappointing UK jobs data, with the GBP/USD exchange rate dipping to 1.2250, marking a 0.5% decline. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0%, raising concerns about the strength of the UK labor market and potential implications for future monetary policy. Traders are now recalibrating their expectations for the Bank of England’s interest rate decisions.

Market participants are shifting their focus to upcoming US economic figures that could influence the USD's performance. The EUR/USD pair is trading around 1.0900, reflecting a stable outlook amid mixed sentiment in the eurozone. As the US prepares to unveil key data, volatility is expected, and traders are advised to stay alert to shifts in exchange rates and market sentiment that could impact their positions.
