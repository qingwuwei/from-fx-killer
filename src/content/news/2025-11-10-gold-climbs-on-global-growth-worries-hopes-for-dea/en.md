Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged above $4,050 in early European trading on Monday, driven by growing concerns over global economic growth. The uncertainty surrounding the US economic outlook has fueled demand for the precious metal as a safe haven asset, attracting cautious traders amidst volatile market conditions.

Despite the upward momentum in gold, optimism surrounding a potential resolution to the US government shutdown may limit further gains. As negotiations unfold, traders are closely monitoring the situation, which could influence the exchange rate for USD and impact overall market sentiment. With the ongoing fluctuations in the forex market, investors are weighing their options carefully in light of these developments.
