The Japanese Yen (JPY) is currently facing downward pressure, trading 0.5% lower against the US Dollar (USD) as we approach the Monday North American session. This decline places the JPY as the weakest performer among the G10 currencies, reflecting a broader sentiment shift in the forex market. Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, highlight the Yen's struggles amid evolving market dynamics.

Market participants are likely reacting to various factors, including shifts in investor sentiment and potential adjustments in monetary policy expectations. As the JPY continues to underperform, traders may reassess their positions, particularly in currency pairs involving the USD and EUR. The ongoing weakness of the Yen could have significant implications for Japan's export-driven economy, potentially leading to increased volatility in the foreign exchange arena.
