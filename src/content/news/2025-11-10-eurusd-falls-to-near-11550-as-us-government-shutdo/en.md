EUR/USD slipped to approximately 1.1550 during the Asian trading session on Monday, marking its fourth consecutive day of losses. The currency pair faced downward pressure as the US Dollar gained traction following reports from Bloomberg indicating that the prolonged US government shutdown is approaching a resolution.

This development has bolstered investor confidence in the USD, resulting in a weaker exchange rate for the euro. As traders adjust their positions in response to the news, the potential end of the shutdown could further impact market dynamics, influencing future movements in the EUR/USD pair.
