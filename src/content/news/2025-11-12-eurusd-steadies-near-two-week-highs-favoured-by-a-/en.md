EUR/USD is showing slight gains on Wednesday, trading at 1.1685, close to the two-week highs above 1.1600 achieved on Tuesday. This upward movement comes in the wake of a disappointing US employment report, which has contributed to a weaker US Dollar.

The softer employment data has shifted market sentiment, favoring the euro as traders evaluate the potential implications for future Federal Reserve monetary policy. As the currency pair continues to hover near recent highs, attention now turns to upcoming economic indicators that could further impact the exchange rate and investor positions in the forex market.
