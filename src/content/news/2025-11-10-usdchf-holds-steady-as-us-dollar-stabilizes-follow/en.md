The USD/CHF currency pair remains stable, trading around 0.8060 on Monday with a slight gain of 0.10% for the day. This steadiness in the exchange rate follows the U.S. Senate's recent approval of a funding measure that will extend the federal budget through January, alleviating concerns over a potential government shutdown. As a result, the U.S. Dollar (USD) has found some footing in the forex market.

The progress on the funding bill has contributed to the stabilization of the USD, providing traders with a sense of security amid ongoing political uncertainties. Market participants are closely monitoring developments, as further economic indicators and geopolitical events could impact the exchange rates of the USD against other currencies, including the Euro (EUR) and the Swiss Franc (CHF).
