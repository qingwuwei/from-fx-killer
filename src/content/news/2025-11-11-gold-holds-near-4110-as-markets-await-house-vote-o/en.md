Gold prices held steady near $4,110 on Tuesday, following a surge to a three-week high of $4,148. The stability comes as traders anticipate a key House vote on a US funding bill, which follows the Senate's approval of a stopgap measure aimed at reopening the government. The outcome of this vote could significantly influence market dynamics, particularly for the USD.

As the situation unfolds, the exchange rate of gold against the USD remains a focal point for traders. Many are closely monitoring how potential government funding stability might impact risk sentiment in the forex markets, especially regarding currency pairs like EUR/USD. A successful passage of the funding bill could bolster the dollar, while failure may lead to a flight to safety, benefiting gold prices once again.
