USD/CAD is experiencing a rebound, trading around 1.4030 during early Asian hours on Tuesday, following two consecutive days of losses. The currency pair is benefiting from a firmer US Dollar (USD) as momentum builds in the Senate towards a resolution for the ongoing government shutdown. This development has provided much-needed support for the USD, influencing the exchange rate positively.

As traders monitor the situation, the potential resolution of the US government impasse is impacting market sentiment, particularly for the USD. A successful agreement could bolster confidence in the US economy, leading to further movements in the USD/CAD currency pair. If the pair manages to hold above the 1.4000 level, it may signal a stronger bullish trend in the coming days.
