ING's FX analyst Francesco Pesole has highlighted that the EUR/USD currency pair is currently about 1% undervalued according to their short-term fair value model. This valuation suggests that the exchange rate may have room for upward movement as market dynamics shift. Traders should monitor this potential correction, which could influence future trading strategies.

As the euro remains underpriced against the USD, investors might find attractive entry points. The interplay between economic data releases and geopolitical developments will likely impact the EUR/USD exchange rate in the coming days. With the euro exhibiting signs of strength in the longer term, traders are advised to keep an eye on market trends that could drive the currency pair back towards its fair value levels.
