EUR/JPY continues its upward trajectory for the fourth consecutive session, now trading at approximately 179.10 during European trading hours on Wednesday. This movement places the currency pair at a critical juncture, testing resistance near the upper boundary of an ascending wedge pattern. As it approaches this technical level, traders are keenly watching for potential breakout opportunities.

The exchange rate's ascent comes amid a backdrop of shifting investor sentiment and market dynamics. The EUR's strength against the JPY highlights broader trends in forex, where fluctuations in major currencies like the USD also play a significant role. A sustained move above the 179.00 mark could signal further bullish momentum for the EUR/JPY pair, potentially attracting more buyers and influencing trading strategies in the coming sessions.
