The Indian Rupee (INR) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) as the USD/INR currency pair trades around the 88.85 level. For nearly a week, the exchange rate has remained in a sideways movement, signaling trader indecision amid a focus on upcoming retail inflation data in India. Investors are keenly monitoring this economic indicator, which could influence monetary policy and market sentiment.

As discussions progress over trade relations between the United States and India, market participants are looking for signs of breakthroughs that could impact the INR's performance. A favorable outcome may strengthen the rupee, while continued uncertainty could lead to further consolidation in the USD/INR pair. With the current trading range established, volatility may increase in response to the inflation data release and any developments in trade talks.
