The USD/CHF currency pair continued its downward trend, marking its fourth consecutive day of losses. As trading reached the North American session on Tuesday, the exchange rate dipped to around 0.8000, reflecting a decline of 0.55%. This slide can be attributed to disappointing US economic data, which weighed on the dollar's performance.

Additionally, a recent reduction in tariffs imposed on Switzerland strengthened the Swiss Franc, further contributing to the USD/CHF's downward momentum. As the market reacts to these developments, traders will be closely monitoring the pair's performance to gauge potential support levels and any signs of a reversal in the current trend.
