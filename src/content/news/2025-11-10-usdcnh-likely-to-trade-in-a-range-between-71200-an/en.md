The USD/CNH exchange rate is expected to maintain a narrow trading range between 7.1200 and 7.1300, as momentum indicators show a mostly flat outlook. According to analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia from UOB Group, the US Dollar appears to have entered a longer-term consolidation phase, fluctuating between 7.1120 and 7.1330.

This range-bound movement in the USD/CNH currency pair suggests a period of stability amid market uncertainties. Traders may focus on key economic data releases and geopolitical developments that could influence the USD's trajectory. As the market adapts to these conditions, participants should stay vigilant for potential breakout opportunities within the established levels.
