EUR/GBP has rebounded from a four-day losing streak, trading near the 0.8800 mark during early European hours on Tuesday. The currency pair's appreciation comes as the Pound Sterling (GBP) weakened following the release of the latest UK labor market data, influencing traders' sentiment in the forex market.

As the exchange rate moves closer to the 0.8800 level, the market is now turning its attention to the German ZEW Survey for further cues. Investors are keen to gauge economic sentiment in the Eurozone, which could impact future trading decisions and the EUR’s strength against the GBP. The overall market dynamics indicate a cautious optimism for the Euro amid fluctuating labor statistics in the UK.
