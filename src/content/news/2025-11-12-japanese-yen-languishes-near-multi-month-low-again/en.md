The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains under pressure, trading close to its lowest level against the US Dollar (USD) since February 13. In the Asian session on Wednesday, the currency pair hovered around the 142.50 mark, reflecting ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy. This lack of decisive buying interest highlights traders' concerns over potential shifts in the BoJ's stance.

Market sentiment continues to weigh heavily on the Yen as investors closely monitor developments from the BoJ. With the exchange rate fluctuating in a range that's seen minimal support, the implications for the JPY could lead to a further depreciation if the current trend persists. The USD's strength against major currencies, including the Euro (EUR), further compounds the JPY's struggles in this challenging trading environment.
