The US Senate has successfully passed a bill to end the government shutdown, paving the way for a House vote in the coming days. While uncertainty remains regarding the bill's ultimate passage, market expectations lean towards a favorable outcome. According to ING's FX analyst, Francesco Pesole, this development has yet to create a significant impact on the USD's exchange rate against major currency pairs.

In the forex market, traders are closely monitoring the USD/EUR exchange rate as they assess the implications of potential fiscal stability. Currently, the USD shows resilience, but the lack of immediate market volatility suggests that traders remain cautious ahead of the House vote. As the situation unfolds, market participants will be looking for clearer signals that could influence trading strategies and impact the USD's performance in the coming weeks.
