The Japanese Yen (JPY) has continued its downward trend for the third consecutive day, hitting a new multi-month low against the US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session. The latest exchange rate shows the JPY trading at 150.75 per USD, reflecting concerns surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) uncertain stance on potential rate hikes. The BoJ's recent Summary of Opinions revealed mixed perspectives among policymakers, contributing to the Yen's weakness.

Market sentiment has also been influenced by optimism surrounding a potential resolution to the US government shutdown, bolstering the USD. As traders anticipate a more stable US economic environment, the pressure on the JPY is likely to persist. Analysts suggest that unless the BoJ signals a more hawkish approach, the JPY may face continued selling pressure against major currencies, including the Euro (EUR) and the USD.
