The EUR/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a tight range of 1.1535 to 1.1575, according to analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia from UOB Group. This range reflects ongoing market stability, as traders await further economic indicators that could influence the euro's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar.

Looking further ahead, UOB Group maintains its perspective that the euro will continue to fluctuate between 1.1485 and 1.1610. This broader range suggests a cautious sentiment as market participants assess the implications of monetary policy decisions and economic data releases, which could sway the dynamics of the EUR/USD trading environment.
