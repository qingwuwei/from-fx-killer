The Indian Rupee (INR) opened flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the USD/INR currency pair trading sideways around the 88.85 level. This stability has persisted for nearly a week as investors remain cautious, awaiting significant developments in the ongoing trade dialogues between the United States and India.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming retail inflation data from India, which could provide insights into the country's economic health and influence future monetary policy decisions. The current exchange rate reflects a period of consolidation, with traders looking for catalysts to drive the currency pair out of its confined range.
