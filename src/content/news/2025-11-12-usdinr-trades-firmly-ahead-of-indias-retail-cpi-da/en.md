The Indian Rupee (INR) faced increased selling pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair trading near 88.80. This uptick in the exchange rate comes as traders position themselves ahead of the highly anticipated release of India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for October at 10:30 GMT.

Market participants are closely watching the CPI figures, as any significant deviation from expectations could influence the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy stance. With the INR underperforming, the stronger USD reflects broader market trends, contributing to nervous trading ahead of key economic indicators that could impact future currency movements.
