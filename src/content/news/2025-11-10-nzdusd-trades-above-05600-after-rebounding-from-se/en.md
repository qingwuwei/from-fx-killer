The NZD/USD currency pair has shown resilience, trading above the 0.5600 level after bouncing back from a seven-month low of 0.5605 observed in the previous session. During the Asian trading hours on Monday, the exchange rate hovered around 0.5630, reflecting a recovery phase for the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar.

This rebound has been fueled by the release of positive economic data from China, New Zealand's largest trading partner. The supportive data has bolstered market confidence, providing a much-needed lift for the kiwi amidst ongoing global economic concerns. Traders will be closely monitoring further developments to gauge the sustainability of this upward momentum.
