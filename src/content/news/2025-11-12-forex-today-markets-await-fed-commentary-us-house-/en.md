Markets are on edge as traders await crucial commentary from the Federal Reserve and a vote in the U.S. House on a funding bill. As of Wednesday, November 12, the EUR/USD exchange rate hovers around 1.0650, reflecting a cautious sentiment among investors. The potential impact of Fed announcements on interest rates is adding volatility to the currency pair, with analysts predicting possible fluctuations based on economic forecasts.

The USD is trading mixed against major currencies, with the USD/JPY pair holding steady around 149.50, while GBP/USD trades near 1.2200. A successful passage of the funding bill could bolster the dollar's strength, whereas any hints of a dovish Fed stance could lead to a pullback. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as they will significantly influence market dynamics in the coming days.
