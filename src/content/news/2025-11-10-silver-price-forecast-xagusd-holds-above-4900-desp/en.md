Silver (XAG/USD) continues to gain traction, trading at approximately $49.20 per troy ounce during the Asian session on Monday. This marks the second consecutive day of gains for the precious metal, as traders react to a more favorable market sentiment. The outlook for silver may be tempered, however, due to an anticipated resolution in U.S. government negotiations, signaling a potential reopening that could impact safe-haven demand.

As the U.S. Senate edges closer to passing a deal, improving economic conditions could shift traders' focus away from silver, leading to potential volatility in the currency pair's exchange rate. Investors are closely monitoring developments, as a stronger USD could exert downward pressure on silver prices, altering the current upward momentum. The interplay between market sentiment and economic policy will be crucial in shaping the trading landscape for XAG/USD in the coming sessions.
