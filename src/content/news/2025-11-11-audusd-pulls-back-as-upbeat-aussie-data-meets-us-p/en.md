AUD/USD is trading slightly lower on Tuesday, hovering around the exchange rate of 0.6530, reflecting a decrease of 0.15% for the day. After reaching a weekly high of 0.6540 on Monday, the currency pair is now consolidating, driven by mixed market sentiment as traders digest recent economic data from Australia.

The recent upbeat economic indicators from Australia provided initial support for the AUD; however, relief stemming from U.S. political developments has tempered bullish momentum. As the market evaluates these conflicting signals, the AUD/USD pair remains in a tight range, suggesting cautious trading ahead as investors await further clarity on economic and political fronts.
