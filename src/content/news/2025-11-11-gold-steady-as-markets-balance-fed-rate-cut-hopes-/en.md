Gold (XAU/USD) is holding its ground on Tuesday, buoyed by ongoing expectations for dovish moves from the Federal Reserve. The precious metal has extended its gains from Monday, trading near three-week highs at approximately $4,140, reflecting a nearly 0.7% increase on the day. This steady momentum indicates a robust bullish sentiment among traders as they weigh potential rate cuts against a diminishing risk of a U.S. government shutdown.

As market participants balance these factors, the exchange rate of gold against the USD continues to attract attention. Investors are closely monitoring the Fed's signals, which may influence broader market trends and impact other currency pairs, including the EUR/USD. With gold's current performance, traders may look to capitalize on continued volatility in the forex markets, especially as economic forecasts evolve.
