The US Dollar (USD) is expected to trade within a narrow range against the Chinese Yuan (CNY), specifically between 7.1170 and 7.1290, as indicated by UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This range-bound trading suggests a period of stabilization for the USD amid fluctuating market conditions.
