EUR/USD has maintained its upward momentum this week, primarily fueled by a weakening US dollar. According to ING's FX analyst Chris Turner, the recent gains in the euro against the dollar reflect shifts in market sentiment rather than any significant strength in the eurozone economy.

As traders continue to capitalize on the softer USD, the EUR/USD exchange rate appears to be on solid footing. This movement highlights the ongoing dynamics in the forex market, where fluctuations in the dollar significantly impact the trading behavior of currency pairs. Investors are closely watching these developments for further insights into future price movements.
