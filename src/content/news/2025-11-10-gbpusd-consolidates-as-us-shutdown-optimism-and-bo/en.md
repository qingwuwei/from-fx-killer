GBP/USD is stabilizing around the 1.3150 level during the North American session on Monday, reflecting a period of consolidation amid shifting market sentiments. Optimism surrounding a potential resolution to the US government shutdown has provided support for the US Dollar (USD), helping it recover from earlier losses and influencing the overall exchange rate.

Market participants are closely monitoring developments in the US, which may bolster the USD's strength.
