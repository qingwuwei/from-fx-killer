Oil prices experienced a significant upswing yesterday, with ICE Brent crude soaring over 1.4%, settling above the pivotal $65 per barrel mark. This rally was largely driven by increased demand for refined products, which has bolstered market sentiment and encouraged traders to pivot their strategies.

The movement in oil prices can have notable implications for currency pairs, particularly those involving the USD and EUR. As oil strengthens, the exchange rate dynamics may shift, influencing inflation rates and economic outlooks in oil-importing and exporting nations alike. Traders should closely monitor these developments as they may impact broader forex trading strategies.
