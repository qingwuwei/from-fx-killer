The USD/JPY currency pair held steady near the 154.00 level on Tuesday, showing minimal movement despite a weaker US Dollar. Investors are closely monitoring the impact of disappointing US jobs data, which has added to market uncertainty and kept the exchange rate in a narrow range. 

Market participants remain cautious regarding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy stance, which has implications for future trading dynamics. The combination of soft US economic indicators and the BoJ's approach is prompting traders to reassess their positions, contributing to the subdued activity. As a result, the USD/JPY pair continues to reflect the balancing act between US economic performance and Japanese monetary policy.
