The US Dollar (USD) displayed mixed trading patterns as market participants navigated a lack of fresh catalysts, with the DXY index last recorded at 99.50. Analysts at OCBC, Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, anticipate that two-way trades will likely continue, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty in the forex market.

In this environment, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rates of major currency pairs, particularly the USD against the euro (EUR) and other key currencies. The current levels suggest potential volatility as market sentiment remains cautious, with investors weighing economic data and geopolitical developments that could influence USD's trajectory in the coming sessions.
