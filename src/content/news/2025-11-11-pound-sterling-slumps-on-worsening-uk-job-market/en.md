The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced a significant decline against major currency pairs on Tuesday, primarily due to disappointing labour market data from the UK. The latest figures for the three-month period ending in September indicate a further deterioration in job market conditions, raising concerns among traders. As a result, the GBP fell sharply, affecting its exchange rate against the USD and EUR.

In the forex market, this shift has led to increased volatility for GBP/USD and GBP/EUR pairs, prompting traders to adjust their positions. The GBP/USD exchange rate dropped to 1.26, while GBP/EUR fell to 1.14, reflecting a broader trend of weakness in the British currency. With ongoing uncertainties in the job market, market participants are closely monitoring future economic indicators, which may influence further trading strategies and sentiment towards the Pound.
