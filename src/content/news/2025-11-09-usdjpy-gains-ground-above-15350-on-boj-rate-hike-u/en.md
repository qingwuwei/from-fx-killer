The USD/JPY currency pair is trading positively, hovering around 153.70 in the early Asian session on Monday. This movement marks a rebound for the pair as the Japanese Yen (JPY) pulls back from its recent peak, which was the highest in over a week. The retreat comes amid growing uncertainty regarding the timing of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) next interest rate hike.
