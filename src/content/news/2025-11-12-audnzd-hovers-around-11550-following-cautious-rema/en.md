AUD/NZD is trading around 1.1550 during the Asian session on Wednesday, showing little movement after a decline of over 0.25% in the previous session. The currency pair has remained near its recent high of 1.1590, reached on November 10, the highest level since September 2013.

The recent caution expressed by RBA’s Hauser has contributed to the subdued trading environment for AUD/NZD. As market participants digest these remarks, the exchange rate's stability may indicate a wait-and-see approach ahead of further economic indicators or central bank announcements, keeping traders alert to potential volatility in the forex market.
