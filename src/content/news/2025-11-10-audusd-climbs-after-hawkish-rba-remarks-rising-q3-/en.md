The AUD/USD currency pair is experiencing upward momentum, climbing to 0.6520 on Monday, marking a gain of 0.40% for the day. This increase follows hawkish remarks from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which have bolstered market sentiment regarding the Australian dollar. 

The rise in Q3 inflation figures has also contributed to the positive trading atmosphere for the AUD against the USD. As traders monitor these developments, the strengthening exchange rate suggests an increased likelihood of further policy tightening by the RBA, potentially influencing future trading strategies in the forex market.
