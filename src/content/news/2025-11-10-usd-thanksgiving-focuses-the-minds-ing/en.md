Developments over the weekend suggest a potential resolution to the US government shutdown, which may influence market sentiment leading into Thanksgiving. A group of moderate Democrats is reportedly supporting a compromise bill in the Senate, motivated by concerns over significant flight delays and delays in food aid payments. This newfound political momentum could strengthen the USD as traders adjust their positions ahead of the holiday.

As the focus shifts to Thanksgiving, the implications for USD performance against major currency pairs are notable. The exchange rate of USD/EUR could see increased volatility if the bill gains traction, potentially impacting trading strategies. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as a resolution may bolster confidence in the US economy and support the dollar heading into a crucial holiday period.
