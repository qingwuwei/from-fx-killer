Recent analysis from UOB Group suggests that the AUD/USD currency pair is currently experiencing price movements indicative of a range-trading phase, oscillating between the technical levels of 0.6510 and 0.6540. According to FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, this lateral movement reflects market consolidation as traders assess broader economic conditions influencing the Australian dollar and the USD.

Looking ahead, the analysts anticipate that the Australian dollar may gradually strengthen within a higher range of 0.6490 to 0.6580. This potential upward shift could be driven by various factors, including shifts in commodity prices and changes in the economic outlook for Australia. Traders should remain vigilant as fluctuations within this range could signal opportunities for strategic positioning in the forex market.
