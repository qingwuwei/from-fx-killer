The GBP is under pressure as Tuesday's jobs data is anticipated to impact sentiment. EUR/GBP has slipped back below the 0.88 mark, reflecting a shift in market dynamics. The exchange rate suggests a growing bearish sentiment toward the British pound, which could influence trading strategies in the coming sessions.

Meanwhile, GBP/USD appears to be attracting demand beneath the 1.31 level, indicating some resilience despite the overall weakness in the currency. Analysts at ING, including FX expert Chris Turner, highlight this demand as a potential buffer for the pound against further decline, emphasizing the significance of upcoming economic data in shaping the currency pair's trajectory.
