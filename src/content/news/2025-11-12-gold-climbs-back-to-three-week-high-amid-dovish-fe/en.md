Gold (XAU/USD) has surged back from earlier lows, trading near a three-week high as the European session unfolds on Wednesday. The precious metal is benefiting from a modest intraday bounce, climbing from sub-$4,100 levels as traders react to dovish sentiments surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Concerns over economic growth are further bolstering gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset.

The softer USD has also played a crucial role in gold's upward momentum, influencing the exchange rates and encouraging investors to shift their focus toward commodities. As the market navigates through these uncertainties, gold's performance suggests a heightened demand amid potential volatility in traditional currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY. The current trading environment reflects a cautious optimism among investors as they monitor economic indicators and central bank signals.
