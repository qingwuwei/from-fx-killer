At the BNP Paribas 9th annual Global Markets Conference, European Central Bank (ECB) board member Isabel Schnabel highlighted that the risks to inflation are slightly skewed towards the upside. She emphasized that the central bank sees no immediate need to adjust interest rates, focusing instead on examining core inflation metrics as a guiding factor for future monetary policy.

This stance may influence trading dynamics in the EUR/USD currency pair, which remains sensitive to ECB policy signals. With exchange rates currently reflecting cautious sentiment, traders will be watching closely for any shifts in inflation data that could prompt the ECB to reconsider its interest rate strategy. The implications of Schnabel's remarks could contribute to increased volatility in the forex market, affecting how investors position themselves against the euro and dollar in the coming weeks.
