EUR/JPY continues its upward trajectory, trading at approximately 178.10 during early European hours on Monday, marking a rise of over 0.25% for the second consecutive session. This bullish momentum is underscored by the currency pair's position above the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting stronger short-term price action.

As the exchange rate approaches record highs, market participants are closely monitoring developments that could drive further gains. The upward movement reflects a broader trend in the forex market, as traders assess the implications of recent economic data and central bank policies affecting the euro and yen. The USD’s performance also remains a focal point, influencing investor sentiment across major currency pairs.
