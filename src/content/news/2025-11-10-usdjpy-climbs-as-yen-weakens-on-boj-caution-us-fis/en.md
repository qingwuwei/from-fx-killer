USD/JPY is trading around 154.00, up 0.40% on the day and nearing its eight-month high of 154.49. The persistent weakness in the Japanese Yen (JPY) has been a significant driver for the currency pair, as traders remain cautious amid uncertainty surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) policy direction.

The recent rise in the USD/JPY exchange rate reflects broader market movements influenced by progress in U.S. fiscal policies. As investors weigh the implications of potential shifts in monetary policy, the ongoing weakness of the JPY suggests a challenging environment for the BoJ as it navigates these external economic pressures.
