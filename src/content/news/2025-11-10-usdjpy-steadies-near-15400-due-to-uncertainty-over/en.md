USD/JPY remains steady near the critical level of 154.00, following an eight-month high of 154.49 reached on November 4. During Asian trading hours on Monday, the currency pair is around 153.90 as the Japanese Yen (JPY) faces headwinds due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) potential rate hike trajectory.

The market's focus is on the implications of BoJ policy, which has left investors cautious and contributed to the Yen's struggles against the US Dollar (USD). This environment of uncertainty may influence future trading strategies, as traders anticipate clearer signals from the BoJ regarding its monetary policy direction.
