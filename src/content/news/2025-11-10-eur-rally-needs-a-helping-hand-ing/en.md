EUR/USD remains relatively stable after finding support just below the 1.15 level last week. According to ING's FX analyst Chris Turner, the currency pair has struggled to gain momentum, indicating a pause in its recent rally. This stagnation may require additional catalysts to reignite upward movement in the exchange rate.

The current trading environment suggests that the euro needs a helping hand to overcome resistance levels and solidify its gains against the USD. As market participants closely monitor economic indicators and geopolitical developments, the EUR's performance in the coming days will be crucial in determining its trajectory against the dollar.
