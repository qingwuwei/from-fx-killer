The USD/CAD currency pair is trading 0.12% lower, hovering around the 1.4030 level during the Asian session on Monday. This decline comes amid ongoing discussions to avert a U.S. federal government shutdown, which has influenced market sentiment. As a result, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) has gained traction, outperforming most of its peers, with the exception of the antipodean currencies.

The recent release of positive Canadian labor market data for October has further bolstered the Loonie, enhancing its appeal among investors.
