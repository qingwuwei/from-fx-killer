West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices showed a bearish trend at the start of the European trading session on Tuesday. WTI is currently trading at $59.78 per barrel, marking a decline from Monday's close of $60.06. This downward movement reflects broader concerns in the market, influenced by fluctuating demand forecasts and geopolitical tensions impacting oil supply.

Brent crude is also experiencing a dip, with prices falling to $63.69 after closing at $63.96 the previous day. The weakening exchange rate for both WTI and Brent may affect related currency pairs, particularly the USD against oil-sensitive currencies. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments, as persistent declines could influence inflationary pressures and central bank monetary policies in the coming weeks.
