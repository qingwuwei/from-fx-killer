Gold (XAU/USD) faced downward pressure on Tuesday, retreating from a three-week high as sellers emerged around the $4,150 mark. After a notable rally on Monday, the precious metal struggled to maintain its momentum, trading at approximately $4,107 during the European session. 

Market dynamics shifted as traders reacted to resistance levels, indicating a potential correction in the exchange rate. The fluctuations in the gold market may reflect broader investor sentiment, influenced by economic indicators and currency movements, particularly concerning the USD and EUR. As trading continues, the focus remains on how these developments will impact gold's trajectory in the near term.
