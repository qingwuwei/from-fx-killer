The Indian Rupee (INR) opened flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, with the USD/INR currency pair consolidating around the exchange rate of 88.80. Market sentiment remains cautious as traders anticipate a US Senate vote on the federal reopening, hoping to resolve concerns regarding a potential government shutdown.

The stability in the USD/INR pair reflects broader market expectations that the US will soon overcome its fiscal impasse. As the USD trades steadily, investors are closely monitoring developments in Washington, which could significantly impact the dollar's strength and, consequently, the INR's performance in the near term. The outcome of the Senate vote may introduce volatility, reshaping trading strategies across the forex market.
