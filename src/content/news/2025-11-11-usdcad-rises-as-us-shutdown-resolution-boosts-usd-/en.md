The USD/CAD currency pair rose to 1.4030 on Tuesday, reflecting a modest increase of 0.10% for the day. This uptick is fueled by growing optimism surrounding a potential resolution to the ongoing US government funding deadlock, which has bolstered the US dollar. Market participants are closely monitoring this development, as it could significantly influence the exchange rate.

However, the Canadian dollar is exhibiting resilience, which is limiting further gains for the USD. As investors await fresh employment data from the US, the interplay between these factors is likely to shape trading strategies in the coming sessions. The market remains cautious, balancing expectations of a stronger USD against the firm performance of the CAD.
