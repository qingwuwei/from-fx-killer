The GBP/USD pair is lingering near the 1.3150 level as the ongoing US government shutdown continues to dampen household sentiment. With the United Kingdom offering few fresh economic releases, market participants are treading carefully in their forex trading decisions. The scarcity of data has limited price movement, leaving the pair with only modest gains on Friday.

At the time of writing the pair is quoted at 1.3148, reflecting a 0.10 % rise after touching a daily low of 1.3095 earlier in the session. This modest bounce suggests a tentative recovery amid a generally subdued trading environment. Traders are watching for any new catalyst that could shift the GBP/USD trajectory, but for now the exchange rate remains anchored around 1.3150, mirroring the cautious stance adopted across the market.
