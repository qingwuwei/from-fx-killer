The Indian Rupee (INR) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR currency pair trading firmly at around 88.80. This stability comes as the US Senate approved a bill aimed at ending the government shutdown, injecting a sense of optimism into the market.

As traders assess the implications of the legislative progress, the exchange rate remains largely unchanged, reflecting a cautious sentiment among investors. The lack of significant movement in the USD/INR pair suggests that while the Indian currency is maintaining its ground, external factors may continue to influence trading dynamics in the days ahead.
