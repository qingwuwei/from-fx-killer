EUR/USD is holding steady around the 1.1560 mark on Monday, reflecting minimal changes in the exchange rate. The US Dollar (USD) has gained renewed momentum as reports from Bloomberg indicate that a coalition of centrist Senate Democrats is poised to support a deal aimed at resolving the ongoing US government shutdown. This development has provided some stability to the USD in the forex market.

As traders closely monitor the situation, Eurozone sentiment remains a critical factor influencing the EUR. The interplay between US legislative progress and Eurozone economic indicators will likely dictate future movements in the currency pair. With the current trading environment, fluctuations in EUR/USD could intensify, depending on how the resolution of the shutdown unfolds and its broader implications for the economy.
