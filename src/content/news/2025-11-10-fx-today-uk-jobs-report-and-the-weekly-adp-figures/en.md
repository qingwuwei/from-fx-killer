The US Dollar (USD) exhibited a lack of direction on Monday, fluctuating as traders reacted to news of a potential resolution to the ongoing 40-day federal government shutdown. Market sentiment improved over the prospect of a deal, influencing trading in key currency pairs. The USD/EUR exchange rate remained stable, hovering around 1.10, as investors assessed the implications of the fiscal stalemate on broader economic stability.

Attention will shift to the upcoming UK jobs report and the weekly ADP figures, which are expected to provide further insights into labor market dynamics. As these key indicators approach, traders are likely to adjust their strategies, keeping a close watch on any shifts in the USD's strength against major currencies. The market's response to these reports could set the tone for the week, shaping expectations for future monetary policy actions.
