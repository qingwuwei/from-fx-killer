EUR/USD is trading lower at around 1.1560 during the Asian session on Tuesday, marking a retreat after four consecutive days of gains. The currency pair is under pressure as the US Dollar strengthens, buoyed by increasing optimism that a resolution to the impending US government shutdown is on the horizon. This development has provided support for the USD, impacting the exchange rate.

As the market awaits the German ZEW Survey data, traders are closely monitoring the potential implications for the Euro. The current trading environment reflects a cautious sentiment, with the EUR/USD pair holding losses near the critical level of 1.1550. The outcome of the ZEW data could further influence the currency pair's trajectory, underscoring the delicate balance of market dynamics at play.
