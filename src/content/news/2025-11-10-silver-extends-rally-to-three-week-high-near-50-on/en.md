Silver (XAG/USD) continued its upward momentum on Monday, trading around $49.85 per ounce, marking a 3.0% increase for the day. Earlier in the trading session, the precious metal peaked at $50.00, the highest level in three weeks. This rally is largely attributed to growing market expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which has bolstered the appeal of silver as a hedge against economic uncertainty.

The strengthening of silver reflects broader trends in the forex market, as traders adjust their positions in response to potential shifts in monetary policy. With the USD under pressure, the exchange rate dynamics are favoring precious metals, prompting increased buying interest. Investors are closely monitoring developments from the Fed, as any signals regarding interest rate adjustments could further influence silver prices and overall market sentiment in the coming days.
