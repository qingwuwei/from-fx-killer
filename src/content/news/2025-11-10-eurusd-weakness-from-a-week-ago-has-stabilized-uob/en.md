The EUR/USD currency pair has shown signs of stabilization following a period of weakness last week. Analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, suggest that the euro (EUR) is likely to trade within a range of 1.1525 to 1.1580 in the immediate term. This consolidation follows fluctuations that have affected investor sentiment and market dynamics.

Looking further ahead, the analysts anticipate that the EUR will continue to oscillate between 1.1485 and 1.1610. This range reflects a cautious market outlook, influenced by broader economic factors and the ongoing strength of the US dollar (USD). As traders navigate these levels, the stability of the euro could signal potential opportunities for those looking to capitalize on future movements in the exchange rate.
