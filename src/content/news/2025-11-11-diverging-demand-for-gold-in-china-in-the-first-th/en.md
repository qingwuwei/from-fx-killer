Commerzbank's commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch has reported on the recent data released by the China Gold Association regarding the country's gold demand in the first three quarters of the year. The findings indicate a diverging trend, with notable discrepancies in demand levels, which could have implications for gold prices and subsequently impact currency pairs such as XAU/USD.

As demand fluctuates, traders in the forex market should remain vigilant, particularly as shifts in gold prices can lead to volatility in related currency pairs. With gold often seen as a safe haven, any increase in demand from China may influence the USD’s strength against the EUR and other currencies, affecting exchange rates and trading strategies across global markets.
