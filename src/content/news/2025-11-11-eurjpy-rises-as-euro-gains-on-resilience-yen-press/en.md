EUR/JPY is trading around 178.30, reflecting a modest increase of 0.10% as of Tuesday. The Euro's recent strength can be attributed to positive economic indicators emerging from Germany, highlighting the region's resilience. As traders sift through these developments, the currency pair appears to benefit from a stable Euro against a backdrop of uncertainty in Japan.

Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen remains under pressure, primarily due to the dovish stance of the Bank of Japan. This approach has raised concerns about Japan’s monetary policy direction, affecting the exchange rate dynamics. As the market continues to react to these economic signals, traders will be closely monitoring any further developments that could influence the EUR/JPY momentum in the coming days.
