The AUD/USD currency pair surged by 0.56% during the European trading session on Monday, reaching a near-term exchange rate of 0.6530. This notable increase comes amid insights from RBA’s Hauser, who reaffirmed a restrictive monetary policy stance, signaling ongoing support for the Australian dollar against the USD.

The market reaction highlights traders' confidence in the RBA's commitment to controlling inflation, which could further bolster the AUD. As the trading week progresses, market participants will closely monitor any additional comments from central bank officials, potentially influencing the direction of the AUD/USD exchange rate in response to broader economic conditions.
