The Canadian Dollar (CAD) gained ground against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, as the USD/CAD currency pair extended losses amid disappointing US labor market data. The exchange rate is currently trading at approximately 1.4008, nearing two-week lows. This shift reflects a broader market sentiment that increasingly anticipates potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

The weakened performance of the USD has fueled speculation over the Fed's monetary policy strategy, with traders adjusting their positions in response to the softer economic indicators. As USD/CAD continues to fluctuate, market participants will be closely monitoring upcoming economic reports for further insights into the trajectory of US interest rates and their implications for the currency pair's future movements.
