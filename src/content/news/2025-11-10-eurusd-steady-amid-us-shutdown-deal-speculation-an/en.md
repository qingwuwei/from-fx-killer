EUR/USD remains stable around the 1.1550 mark on Monday, as the currency pair exhibits little movement amid ongoing speculation regarding a potential resolution to the US government shutdown. Reports from Bloomberg indicate that the White House is supportive of a deal aimed at ending the shutdown soon, which has led to a slight recovery for the USD.

At the time of writing, the exchange rate for EUR/USD is flat at 1.1560. Market participants are closely monitoring developments, as any progress on the shutdown could have significant implications for the USD's strength and overall trading sentiment in the forex market.
