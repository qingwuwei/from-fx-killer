The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, marking its second consecutive day of gains. The AUD/USD pair climbed as traders reacted to the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) cautious tone, which suggests a careful approach to future monetary policy adjustments. This sentiment has helped bolster the AUD, with the exchange rate reflecting increased investor confidence.

In addition to RBA's positioning, easing trade tensions between the US and China have contributed to the Aussie’s rise. The improving geopolitical landscape has encouraged risk-taking among investors, further supporting the AUD. As the currency pair continues to trade higher, attention will remain on upcoming economic indicators that could influence further movements in the AUD/USD exchange rate.
