EUR/GBP continued its upward trajectory for the second consecutive session, trading around 0.8810 during the early European hours on Wednesday. This rise follows the release of German HICP inflation data, which has provided support for the euro against the pound. The exchange rate reflects a positive sentiment in the market as traders reassess their positions following the inflation figures.

As the currency pair holds gains above 0.8800, market participants are closely monitoring further economic indicators that could influence the euro's strength. The recent data suggests a resilient economy in Germany, potentially bolstering the EUR against other currencies. The implications for the broader forex market could be significant, especially for those holding positions in USD, as shifts in EUR/GBP often impact trading strategies across various currency pairs.
