The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its downward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, marking a second consecutive session of losses. The AUD/USD pair traded lower as market sentiment favored the USD amid ongoing efforts to reopen the United States government. This development has bolstered the USD, enhancing its appeal among traders.

As the exchange rate fluctuates, the AUD is pressured despite the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) cautious stance, which typically supports the currency. The current trading conditions highlight the AUD's vulnerability in the face of a strengthening USD, raising concerns about future performance and potential support levels for the AUD/USD pair in the coming sessions.
