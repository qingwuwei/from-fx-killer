Gold (XAU/USD) surged to approximately $4,050 during the Asian trading session on Monday, driven by increasing bets on a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This movement reflects the growing uncertainty surrounding the US economic outlook, as traders react to shifting monetary policy expectations. The rising demand for the precious metal highlights its safe-haven appeal amid market volatility.

Despite the upward momentum, hopes for a resolution to the ongoing government shutdown may limit gold’s gains. As discussions around fiscal stability continue, the interplay between the USD and gold prices could create a complex trading environment. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, which could significantly influence exchange rates and market sentiment in the coming days.
