The USD/INR currency pair has shown signs of upward momentum as India's retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has cooled to just 0.25%. This downturn in inflation indicates a potential easing of pressure on the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy, which could impact the INR's exchange rate against major currencies.

As a result, the Indian Rupee is likely to face increased downside risk against its peers. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of this inflation data, which may lead to shifts in market sentiment and trading strategies. With the USD gaining traction, the outlook for the INR remains uncertain as it grapples with these economic indicators.
