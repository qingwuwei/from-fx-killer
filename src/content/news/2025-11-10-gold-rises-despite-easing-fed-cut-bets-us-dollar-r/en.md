Gold prices surged over 2% on Monday, driven by heightened speculation surrounding a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in December. As traders adjusted their positions, the yellow metal demonstrated resilience despite a stronger US Dollar, which gained traction amid news of a possible US government reopening. The increase in gold prices reflects ongoing uncertainty in the market, where safe-haven assets remain appealing.

In the currency markets, the USD rallied against major pairs, including the EUR and GBP, as the exchange rate dynamics shifted in response to these developments. While Gold's upward movement suggests a robust demand from investors, the improving outlook for the Greenback could complicate trading strategies. With the Federal Reserve's next steps under scrutiny, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence future monetary policy.
