West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has shown resilience, trading around $60.75 per barrel on Tuesday, reflecting a 1.20% increase. This upward movement is primarily driven by optimism surrounding the reopening of the US government, which is expected to boost economic activity and, consequently, oil demand. Traders are closely monitoring the situation as it unfolds, weighing it against ongoing supply concerns.

As the market reacts to these developments, the implications for the USD remain significant, particularly in relation to other currencies like the EUR. Strengthening oil prices can enhance USD value against its peers, influencing exchange rates and trading strategies. Investors are advised to stay alert to potential shifts in the energy market and broader economic indicators that could affect currency pairs in the coming days.
