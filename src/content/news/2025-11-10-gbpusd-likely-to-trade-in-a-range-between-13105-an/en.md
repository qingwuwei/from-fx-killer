The GBP/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a range of 1.3105 to 1.3175 in the short term, according to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This range indicates a stabilization in the exchange rate, following a period of volatility. Analysts suggest that while the Pound Sterling has faced weakness, it may be on the path to recovery.

In a broader context, any potential gains for the GBP are likely to fall within a higher range of 1.3050 to 1.3220. This outlook reflects a shift in market sentiment, as traders assess economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could impact the Pound's performance against the USD. As such, the current trading environment remains cautious yet optimistic for GBP investors.
