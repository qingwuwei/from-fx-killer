Gold prices surged at the start of the week, climbing by as much as 3.7%, or $150, to reach $4,150 per troy ounce. Commerzbank's commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch attributed this significant rise to heightened demand in the market, driven by a combination of geopolitical tensions and shifts in investor sentiment toward safe-haven assets.

As traders react to fluctuating market conditions, the movement in gold prices could influence currency pairs, particularly against the USD and EUR. The ongoing volatility may prompt further trading activity, as investors seek to capitalize on these price movements and reassess their positions in the precious metals market.
