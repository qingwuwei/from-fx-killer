Gold (XAU/USD) has shown some resilience, bouncing back from intraday lows below $4,100. Currently, the precious metal is trading with a slight negative bias just under a three-week high as the European session unfolds. The recent fluctuations are influenced by a firmer USD, which has added pressure on gold prices.

As the exchange rate for gold remains volatile, traders are closely monitoring the impact of the stronger dollar and its implications for future trading strategies. The current level is critical, as a sustained push above the three-week high could signal further bullish momentum, while dips below $4,100 may lead to increased bearish sentiment in the market.
