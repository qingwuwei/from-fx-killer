Gold (XAU/USD) is holding steady near a three-week high, as it trades just below the peak reached earlier this Tuesday. Despite some modest intraday gains observed in the early European session, the yellow metal's upward momentum appears to be limited by a slight uptick in the USD. Currently, traders are closely monitoring exchange rate fluctuations between the dollar and other currencies, such as the EUR.

The recent performance of gold reflects a complex interplay between demand for safe-haven assets and movements in the USD.

This dynamic underscores the importance of currency pair movements in determining future trading strategies in the precious metals market.
