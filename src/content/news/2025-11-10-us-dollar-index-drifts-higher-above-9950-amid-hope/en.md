The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading positively around 99.65 during the Asian session on Monday, reflecting an upward drift above the 99.50 mark. This movement comes amid growing optimism that the ongoing US government shutdown may soon come to an end, providing a boost to investor sentiment towards the USD.
