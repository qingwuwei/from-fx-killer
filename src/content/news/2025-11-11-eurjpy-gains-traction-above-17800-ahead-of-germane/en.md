The EUR/JPY currency pair is gaining momentum, trading near 178.35 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This upward movement is attributed to a stronger Euro (EUR) as improved risk sentiment boosts demand against the Japanese Yen (JPY). Traders are closely watching the upcoming release of the German and Eurozone ZEW Economic Sentiment Index, which could further influence the exchange rate.

As market participants anticipate the ZEW data, the outlook for the Eurozone economy is coming under scrutiny. Should the sentiment indices reflect positive economic projections, the EUR could continue to strengthen against the JPY, reinforcing the current bullish trend and potentially driving the exchange rate past key resistance levels.
