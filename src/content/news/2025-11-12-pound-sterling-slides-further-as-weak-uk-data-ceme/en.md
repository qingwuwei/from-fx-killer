The Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing significant losses against its major currency peers, with the exception of the Japanese Yen (JPY), as it trades under pressure. Market sentiment is increasingly shaped by the release of disappointing UK economic data, fueling expectations for further rate cuts from the Bank of England (BoE) at its upcoming December meeting. Currently, GBP/USD is hovering around 1.2300, reflecting a notable decline.

In contrast, the EUR/GBP exchange rate has seen an uptick, indicating a shift in market dynamics. As traders reassess their positions, the implications of a potentially dovish BoE weigh heavily on the GBP’s outlook. The growing anticipation of monetary policy easing in the UK suggests that the Pound could continue to struggle, impacting trading strategies and positioning against major currencies such as the USD and EUR.
