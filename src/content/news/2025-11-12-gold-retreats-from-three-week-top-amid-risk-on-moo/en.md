Gold (XAU/USD) faced selling pressure during the Asian session on Wednesday, halting its three-day winning streak after reaching a three-week high of $4,150-4,155. The shift in market sentiment towards a risk-on mood has contributed to a decline in demand for safe-haven assets like gold, prompting traders to take profits following the recent rally.

Additionally, a resurgence in demand for the USD has further pressured the yellow metal. As investors focus on economic recovery and favorable currency exchange rates, the upward momentum for gold appears to be stalling. Market participants will be closely monitoring upcoming economic data that could influence the USD and, consequently, the dynamic of gold trading in the near term.
