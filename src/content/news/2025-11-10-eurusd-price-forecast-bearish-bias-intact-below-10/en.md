The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing mild losses, currently trading around 1.1565 during the early European session on Wednesday. This dip comes as the US Dollar (USD) gains traction against the Euro (EUR), driven by increasing optimism that a resolution to the US government shutdown may be imminent. 

The bearish sentiment for EUR/USD remains intact as the exchange rate hovers below the critical 100-day EMA, positioned near 1.1550. Traders are closely monitoring this technical level, as sustained movement below it could signal further declines in the pair. As market participants weigh the implications of potential fiscal stability in the US, the outlook for the Euro continues to face pressure.
