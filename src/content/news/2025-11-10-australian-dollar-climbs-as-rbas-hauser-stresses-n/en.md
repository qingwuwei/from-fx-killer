The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, marking a continuation of its upward momentum for the second consecutive session. As the exchange rate climbed, AUD/USD traded around 0.6500, reflecting a notable recovery fueled by positive sentiment in the forex market.

The rally was largely driven by comments from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Michele Bullock, who emphasized the necessity of maintaining a tight monetary policy stance to combat inflation. As traders adjusted their positions based on these insights, the AUD’s gains against the USD signaled growing confidence in Australia's economic outlook, potentially impacting future trading strategies within the currency pair.
