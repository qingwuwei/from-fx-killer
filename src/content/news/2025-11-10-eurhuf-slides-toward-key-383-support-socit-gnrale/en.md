The EUR/HUF currency pair is currently experiencing a consistent decline, moving towards the critical support zone between 383 and 382. This trend is highlighted by Société Générale's FX analysts, who note that the pair is approaching the lower boundary of its descending channel. 

Market sentiment appears to be influencing this downward movement as traders remain cautious amid fluctuating exchange rates. As the EUR/HUF nears this pivotal support level, market participants will be closely monitoring for potential rebounds or further declines, which could signal shifts in trading strategies. The implications of this trend could affect broader currency movements, particularly in relation to the USD and other major pairs.
