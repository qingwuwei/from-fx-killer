The Pound Sterling (GBP) is showing a cautious upward trend as it extends last week’s recovery into the Monday North American session. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the GBP is trading within a tight range, indicating a measured approach among traders as they assess market dynamics. 

The exchange rate movements suggest a potential stabilization in GBP/USD after recent fluctuations, as the currency pair seeks new support levels. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical factors, which could further influence the direction of the GBP against the USD and EUR in the coming days. The ongoing recovery may signal a shift in sentiment, but caution remains prudent amid evolving market conditions.
