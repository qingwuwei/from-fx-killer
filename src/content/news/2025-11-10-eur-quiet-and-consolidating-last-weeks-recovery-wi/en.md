The Euro (EUR) is hovering in the mid-1.15s as it consolidates last week's gains, remaining steady as it enters the North American trading session unchanged from Friday's close. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, this stability reflects a stronger position for the Euro against the USD, supported by favorable spreads.

As market participants assess the current exchange rate dynamics, the EUR/USD currency pair shows resilience amid ongoing economic developments. Traders are closely monitoring these movements, as they could signal potential opportunities for positioning in the forex market, particularly given the Euro's recent recovery trend.
