Silver (XAG/USD) is currently trading at approximately $51.70, reflecting a 1.00% increase for the day and marking a continuation of its recent upward momentum. This rise is largely driven by escalating expectations that the Federal Reserve may implement another interest rate cut in December, which has prompted traders to turn towards the precious metal as a safe haven.

The growing concerns surrounding the US economy further bolster silver's appeal. As market participants anticipate potential economic slowdowns, the demand for silver as a hedge against uncertainty continues to grow. With the current exchange rate positioning, silver remains a favored choice for investors looking to navigate the volatility in the USD and broader financial markets.
